# SARIMAX vs. TensorFlow Models vs. Linear Regression: A Comparative Dive into Regression Models

Welcome to this project! Here, we explore three powerful approaches to regression modeling—**Linear Regression (sklearn)**, **SARIMAX**, and **TensorFlow-based Models**—and compare their strengths, use cases, and performance using Python. Whether you're predicting house prices, forecasting time-series trends, or scaling to big data, this project dives into how these models tackle linear regression tasks.

## Project Overview
Regression analysis is a cornerstone of predictive modeling, and choosing the right model depends on your data and goals. This project implements and compares:
- **Linear Regression (sklearn.linear_model)**: The classic, interpretable choice for static, linear relationships.
- **SARIMAX**: A time-series model with exogenous inputs, perfect for temporal data with external drivers.
- **TensorFlow Models**: A flexible, scalable framework for custom regression, from simple linear fits to complex neural networks.

Using Python, we apply these models to a dataset, analyze their performance, and highlight what sets them apart.

## Models Explained
### 1. Linear Regression (sklearn)
- **What it is**: A straightforward model assuming a linear relationship between features and a continuous target (e.g., `y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + … + βₙxₙ`).
- **Strengths**: Simple, fast, and highly interpretable.
- **Use Case**: Predicting car prices based on mileage and age.
- **Library**: `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`

### 2. SARIMAX
- **What it is**: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors—a mouthful, but a powerhouse for time-series data.
- **Strengths**: Handles trends, seasonality, and external predictors.
- **Use Case**: Forecasting sales with historical data and marketing spend.
- **Library**: `statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax`

### 3. TensorFlow Models
- **What it is**: A custom-built linear regression using TensorFlow’s neural network framework (e.g., a single-layer model with no activation).
- **Strengths**: Scales to large datasets and adapts to complex problems.
- **Use Case**: Predicting server load with millions of data points.
- **Library**: `tensorflow.keras`

## How It Works
This project uses Python to:
1. **Prepare Data**: Load and preprocess a dataset suited for regression (static or time-series).
2. **Implement Models**: Code each model—Linear Regression, SARIMAX, and TensorFlow—tailored to the data.
3. **Compare Results**: Evaluate performance (e.g., mean squared error) and interpretability.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn statsmodels tensorflow pandas numpy
  ```
- more if needed

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
   
### Running the Project
- Open `linear-regression-v2.py` (or your main script).
- Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV with features and target).
- Run the script:
  ```bash
  python linear-regression-v2.py
  ```

## Troubleshooting
- **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'**? Install it:
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```
- Check your Python environment and ensure all libraries are installed in the same one.

## Why This Matters
Understanding these models helps you pick the right tool for the job—whether it’s the simplicity of Linear Regression, the temporal depth of SARIMAX, or the scalability of TensorFlow. Dive into the code to see them in action!
